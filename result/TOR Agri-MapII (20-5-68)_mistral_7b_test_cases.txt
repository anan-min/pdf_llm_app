1. Project Title: Smart Agriculture System for Increasing Farm Productivity and Efficiency

   2. Project Description: The project aims to develop a smart agriculture system that uses IoT, AI, and machine learning technologies to monitor and optimize farm operations, improve crop yields, reduce waste, and increase overall efficiency in the agricultural sector.

   3. Objectives:
       - Develop an IoT-based system for monitoring soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors.
       - Implement AI and machine learning algorithms to predict crop growth patterns, identify pests and diseases, and suggest optimal irrigation and fertilization schedules.
       - Design a user-friendly mobile application for farmers to easily access and manage their farm data.
       - Conduct on-site trials and testing to validate the effectiveness of the smart agriculture system.

   4. Project Timeline: The project will be completed within 270 days from the date of signing the contract.

   5. Budget: The total budget for this project is THB 96,450,000 (approx. USD 3,100,000).

   6. Location: Department of Agriculture and Cooperation, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, Phahonyothin Road, Lad Yao, Chatuchak, Bangkok, Thailand

   7. Project Manager: The project will be managed by the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives.

   8. Scope of Work:
       - Design, develop, and implement the smart agriculture system, including hardware, software, and mobile application components.
       - Provide training and support to farmers on using the system effectively.
       - Conduct regular maintenance and updates to ensure smooth operation of the system.
       - Collaborate with relevant stakeholders, such as agricultural experts, researchers, and policymakers, to improve the system and its impact.
